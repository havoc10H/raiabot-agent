ChatGPT Clone for Custom AI Assistants

The goal of this application is to build a interface that is similar to chat GPT but it is accessing custom AI assistance built using the open AI api.  

We have customers who we build custom AI assistants for them and they want to be able to access the AI assistant via a similar UX.  

This GPTClone will integrate with our current software via API and be able to grab the following

    1. Authenticate a user login
    2. Retrieve all key user info (company name, users name etc)
    3. Retrieve all AI Assistants the user has access to.

The user will login to the application and they will be able to choose which AI Assistant they want to chat with. Once they choose one, they can type into the prompt and it will begin having a conversation (thread/messages) via OpenAI API with that AI assistant.

Each thread will be visible on the left nav bar just like ChatGPT. So they can retrieve old threads easily.
